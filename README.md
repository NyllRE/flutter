# Nyll's Dart Playground
<br>

## this project is my dart / flutter playground to play around with all of what I've learned
<br>

<br>
<br>

> all of the code put in this codebase is taken from [Dart's Documentation]('https://dart.dev/guides') and from [Flutter's Documentation]('https://flutter.dev/') so I'd suggest you learn from them and take this project as reference

<br>
<br>

### this codebase contains heavy documentation to every part of the code, with comments beautified by [Better Comments]('https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments') so I highly recommend you install this extension in general
